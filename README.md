Welcome to the West Virginia State University Cyber, AI & Robotics Club ( YELLOW H@CKETS )! — the first club at WVSU dedicated to Cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence, and Robotics.

Our club is a student-led community focused on learning, innovation, and collaboration. We bring together students who are curious about technology, interested in hands-on experience, and motivated to grow their skills while working on real-world problems.

Whether you are a beginner or have prior experience, you are welcome here. Join us to learn, build, explore, and shape the future of technology at WVSU.
